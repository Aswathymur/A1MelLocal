## Project : MelLocal

Our project is a web application and as an extended feature, it will be a phone application, directed towards Tourists in Melbourne as a travel attraction application. Our app named MelLocal is a map which serves a purpose of directing Tourists to the best restaurants, bars and fun activities to do in Melbourne that are described as ‘experiences’ within our website application.

It lists information for an experience such as an average cost price, customer reviews and ratings. It also allows the user to filter through the search results, such as price preferences and whether they want bars, restaurants or other experiences to appear in the search results. It allows the user to create their own profile to save favourite experiences to a designated special folder. Local businesses can sign-up to the app to promote their business and list services they offer by filling in details of their business.

This project is unique due to its ability to perform a recognition feature. Tourists can capture an image of a location to retrieve its information on prices, reviews and ratings. They can also capture an image of a monument or historical building to gather information on its history. Thus, delivering an insightful and fun experience when using the app. As a team, we plan to create this web application with HTML, CSS, Python Flask and Javascript.
