            <h2>What</h2>
            <h3>Section C</h3>

            <h4>Project Name: MelLocal</h4>

            <h4>Project Description</h4>

            <p>Our project is a web application and as an extended feature, it will be a phone application, directed towards Tourists in Melbourne as a travel attraction application. Our app named MelLocal is a map which serves a purpose of directing Tourists to the best restaurants, bars and fun activities to do in Melbourne that are described as ‘experiences’ within our website application.</p>

            <p>It lists information for an experience such as an average cost price, customer reviews and ratings. It also allows the user to filter through the search results, such as price preferences and whether they want bars, restaurants or other experiences to appear in the search results. It allows the user to create their own profile to save favourite experiences to a designated special folder. Local businesses can sign-up to the app to promote their business and list services they offer by filling in details of their business.</p>

            <p>This project is unique due to its ability to perform a recognition feature. Tourists can capture an image of a location to retrieve its information on prices, reviews and ratings. They can also capture an image of a monument or historical building to gather information on its history. Thus, delivering an insightful and fun experience when using the app. As a team, we plan to create this web application with HTML, CSS, Python Flask and Javascript.</p>

            <h3>Demonstratable Outcomes</h3>

            <h4>Project Motivation</h4>
            <p>Following the ban on international travellers entering Australia in March 2020, the tourism industry has encountered significant downturn. In an effort to promote tourism in Melbourne we have decided to create an app that helps businesses and locals connect. This type of application poses challenging yet feasible tasks, such as interacting with a map API and designing an efficient and intuitive User Interface. Along with this our group has a strong interest in integrating image recognition as an additional tool that will enrich the map data displayed to the user. The reasons for this are to promote Melbourne as an in demand international travel location and help Melbourne businesses in their efforts to expand their market share. The integration of an image recognition tool serves as a unique selling point for this type of application and one which will challenge our technical expertise. </p>

            <h5>Luke</h5>
            <p>As an international student, exploring Melbourne and visiting local places (not just tourist attractions) have become a hobby and one of my essential needs since my first moment arrived in Australia. This is my motivation behind the app and I’m also looking forward to further improving the practical application of my skill with back-end development, especially with Java and Python programming languages. Collaborating with other members with more experiences with these areas during the features development phase of the project would directly help me to extend my knowledge and understand how to apply them. Team building is also an important skill that I want to get more familiar with because it’s made up of soft skills such as communication, time management and collaboration that can be trained throughout this project.</p>

            <h5>Harry</h5>
            <p>As an exchange student and arriving in Melbourne for the first time, everything was too strange for me. From the buildings, transportation to the culture in here, it is very different and modern from the country I used to live in. I love discovering new things, however, lack of information or reviews about a particular restaurant or hotel makes it impossible to venture in, as the Australian currency is much higher to the country I live in. I wonder if there is a website or application that helps travelers to get information and honest user reviews. A website that lets me know where I am, what’s around me and where I want to go most. That is the reason why I decided to make a tourism website for this project.</p>

            <h5>Laura</h5>
            <p>The motivation behind this project idea was driven by the experience I have seen my international student friends have. I have seen them struggle to navigate through Melbourne in general, and the experiences Melbourne has to offer them. They only seem to manage by having a local student from Melbourne help them to know the best restaurants, bars and fun things to do. That is why I felt that there needed to be a dedicated Melbourne Tourist app that provided information such as restaurants, bars and experiences for visitors to Melbourne. Although it was important to include interesting features such as ratings, reviews and the recognition feature to make it more interesting for the user, when exploring Melbourne. This app wouldn't just be useful for my International friends, but it would also be handy for new residents and more importantly, Tourists visiting Melbourne.</p>

            <h5>Aswathy</h5>
            <p>The tourism industries in and around Melbourne have created various apps and websites to keep up with the tourism boom that Melbourne was experiencing prior COVID-19. Though these apps have been made to help the tourists navigate through and enjoy Melbourne with ease, it doesn’t serve the purpose. The motivation behind MelLocal is to provide the tourists with an user friendly website/app that helps them navigate through Melbourne and its surroundings. The creators of the previous tourism websites haven’t looked through the eyes of the tourist to understand their needs. Melbourne has a vibrant street life and getting lost in between this is not hard as a tourist. Including features such as Image recognition will help them get a sense of location and confidence in exploring more places. The aim of MelLocal is to promote Melbourne tourism while also promoting the local businesses. The Business will get their separate log in as a business owner to publish their business. This will help the local businesses, post covid world which inturn helps the economy boom.</p>

            <h5>Shanogeeth</h5>
            <p>Tourism has a big demand around the world. Melbourne is one of the most amazing cities to experience the Australian culture along with some pleasing places to visit. Most of the international students are looking to visit places and experience the variety of food available in  Melbourne along with the culture for an affordable cost. But the majority of them ignore the opportunity due to the high expenses given by the existing tourism websites. By bringing MelLocal to the market we are mostly targeting the international students as well the tourists to navigate them to experience some best locations in Melbourne along with local restaurants and bars for an affordable cost. Apart from that , we are looking to promote some local businesses by advertising them on the website for tourists to energize themselves. </p>

            <h5>Eliza</h5>
            <p>Having worked in a commercial bus company I realised how much of Melbourne’s economy revolves around the tourism industry. This is a tough industry that has a lot of room for improvement when it comes to utilising tools to improve business processes. An application that improves visitors' experience of Melbourne would be a win/win for both tourists and Melbourne businesses. As well as this the extended feature of Image Recognition can help to serve as a platform for enriching people’s knowledge of Melbourne and its heritage buildings, parks and attractions. As the tourism industry is facing significant downturn, the reboot of the Melbourne visitor economy is a pertinent issue. I am excited to be a part of this project and explore these issues whilst simultaneously improving our technical skills</p>
