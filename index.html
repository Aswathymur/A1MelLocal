                    <h3>Le Gia Thuan [s3695519]</h3>
                    <p>In Vietnam, I became interested in technology in the world and have always wanted to explore them since I was in secondary school. Until I was in high school, I got acquainted with coding and arduino, I felt that everything was new and amazing but also many challenges. In 12th grade, an IT teacher gave me a lot of energy and opportunities that the IT industry offers. In 2018, I decided to set foot in RMIT Vietnam and follow my passion although my family directed me through business major.</p>

                    <p>At RMIT Vietnam, I am very interested in web design, arduino and SQLite database management. In addition, I have completed the Photography 101 class to cover myself with photography knowledge and photo editing applications like Adobe Lightroom, which can help my design array better when creating web or design. for phone applications. Finally, the array I feel most confident is managing data with SQLite</p>

                    <p>Now I feel like I need to improve my Java or Python programming array. This is also a problem thatI need to develop more in the future to be able to gain the skills of a good programmer.</p>

                    <p>As technology continues to evolve around us, I have always been keen in knowing more about its growth. I initially started doing small animation projects and competitions. I later went on to do more IT based subjects throughout High school. After year 12, I was offered an internship with St Peter’s college as a Front Desk IT support. In the meantime of my internship I also completed a Cert IV in Information Digital Media and Technology. With my initial interest in IT I did various courses online to get a base in programming languages(python, java). I am currently interested in pursuing a career in Data analytics.</p>

                    <p> Data is my strong side and I am hoping to develop more skills in this field to make this my career. Other skills that I developed over the years are HTML, CSS and Java, and improving my skill sets on these are still an ongoing process.</p>

                    <p>I would like to improve my skills within the design, code and the research aspect of the project.</p>

                    <h3>Laura Younger [s3850581]</h3>
                    <p>I decided to transfer from a Bachelor of Nursing to a degree in IT last year. I began to gain more of an interest in Technology when I started to work as an assistant for a founder of an IT banking company. The work environment was ideal and he taught me alot about the industry. I am also interested in the research field as I worked with a lead researcher who’s team devoted their time to researching how to use brain neurons in a chip, which relied heavily on coding. I feel I could use my nursing and theory skills combined with IT to contribute to society.</p>

                    <p>I am skilled at HTML, CSS and Java programming. I really enjoy Java programming and would like to extend my skill set within this topic.</p>

                    <p>I am not strong at python as I am just learning it this semester. I am also not very skilled at SQL programming and databases.</p>

                    <p>I would hope to work within the research and coding aspects of the project as I enjoy researching and would like to upskill my coding skills.</p>

                    <h3>Eliza Gilbert [s3165643]</h3>
                    <p>I started studying IT in 2013, initially in the area of Cybersecurity after transitioning from RMIT’s School of Health Science where I was studying a Bachelor of Psychology. Since then I have completed a Diploma of Web Development and I am focusing on adopting industry standard development environments and processes. I’d like to complete a  Bachelor of Information Technology to fill the gap in terms of my  development experience. </p>

                    <p>In my free time I used to do a lot of Hackathons, including Unihack and Govhack however most recently I worked for a Bus Company where I was the office manager.</p>

                    <p>This involvement in hackathons was both rewarding however it encourages unplanned building of a product without real structure. I’d like to gain experience in building iterations of a product and sticking to a very defined scope.</p>

                    <p>I expect to be involved a lot in the planning and research parts of the projects, as I am quite good at weighing up the pros and cons of taking the project in certain directions.</p>

                    <p>I came to Australia 4 years ago for high school and this is my first year in RMIT. I’ve been designing websites, ecommerce stores, graphics like icons/logos/banners and user interface for clients since 2016. But with basic coding knowledge, it becomes challenging for me whenever it comes down to backend development. Completing the Bachelor of Information Technology would open up more opportunities and further develop my technical skills.</p>

                    <p>I’m more on the visual front-end side and I’ve strong experiences with graphic designing softwares, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, and Figma. Working with a broad variety of industries including dental clinics, marketing solutions, engineering, electronic stores, camera brand, streetwear brand,... allows me to have solid understanding in the business field, which would be beneficial when it comes to the practical side of a project.</p>

                    <p>I’m looking forward to further developing my knowledge with codes, especially Java and Python, and gaining more experience working in a team. </p>

                    <p>Technology plays a major role in organizations nowadays. Having a huge interest in Electronics from childhood motivated me to learn more about Technology and it’s growth . Once I finished my school career I joined an IT institute to gain more knowledge about the IT industry. I joined RMIT for a Bachelor in Information Technology and now i'm in my second year of education.</p>

                    <p>I’m skilled at HTML , CSS and Java . With the basic knowledge of Java programming i enjoyed doing Introduction to Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals.</p>

                    <p>I’m not good at SQL programming and databases where I found it a bit difficult in my previous courses and I'm starting to learn Python where I have done quite few projects on them.</p>

                    <p>I would hope to work on research , designing and on coding perspective where I can develop my knowledge and gain more experience by contributing and working with the team.</p>
