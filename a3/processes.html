              <h2>Project Processes</h2>
              <h4>What have you learned about group projects? What has worked well in your group? What has not worked well?</h4>

              <p>Working as a group in the past 12 weeks under such challenging circumstances was an experience like never before. With this whole new experience, we learned a lot of new things.</p>

              <h5>Organisation</h5>
              <p>It was very important that the team worked together and completed all tasks that are assigned to them and worked together to organise times for meeting and to resolve issues. The team’s organisation had to be made sure to ensure that the team worked together cohesively.</p>

              <h5>Team Communication</h5>
              <p>As a team, communication has played a very important role in this assignment. Everyone had the right to speak up about all the decisions that were made throughout. Using Microsoft Teams as our base communication tool, we have learned to adapt to tough circumstances, and to communicate and work from remote environments.</p>

              <h5>Time Management</h5>

              <p>We have learnt as a group from our experience in this assignment the importance of time management. We had a little bit of a gap due to other assignments being due right after the submission of assignment 2. We later caught up with all the work that taught us the importance of time and how time management could still get us back on track.</p>

              <p>As a group we have made sure to be on top of our ideas and planning throughout the course of the semester. We were clear on where our assignment was leading us to and we were clear about the ideas. However, we faced a lot of issues after we had a gap with our meeting. The gap occurred due to the increased assignment pressure from other subjects, leading to less communication between us. This also brought up another issue with 2 simultaneous different developments happening. The lack of communication affected the development stage the most. We still managed to revive from these gaps and get our team back on track with good time management and organisation skills.</p>

              <h4>What are the group’s processes for communication? How were they? Have there been any changes since the start of the semester?</h4>

              <p>The group mainly relied on the teams group chat for all our communication. We had weekly fixed meetings every week on Thursdays at 3:30 pm, where we discussed and updated all our tasks and agendas for the week ahead. This method of communication stayed consistent throughout the project. We had our Trello cards attached to this team’s group which also allowed the teams group to be a one stop destination for all our group needs and resources. Trello also acted as a tracker for all our work and acted as an indirect communication platform. We could view other team members’ tasks in the Trello cards to see the progress the team was making.</p>

              <h4>From our experience in this project, what is the most important aspect of organising a project of this nature? Is there anything that you would do differently if you were to start again?</h4>

              <p>The main take away from this project is to plan any work ahead of the date. Leaving things to the last minute does not always bring the best results. We had time to revive from our mistakes, but these mistakes could have been avoided earlier on in the project's process. We as a group should have conducted a meeting for at least half an hour to check on the other team members and work accordingly. This flaw of ours leads to 2 different developments, and then some extra work to put them together. This could have surely been avoided in this process. This would have immensely reduced the amount of work towards the end of the assignment and would have allowed us to produce a much better product with fewer bugs.</p>

              <h4>What advice would you give to a group about to embark on a similar project?</h4>

              <p>The most important thing for a group is communication and acceptance. Take in everyone’s view on the project and understand what your fellow members are trying to convey. Keep your fellow team members up to date with all the work you are doing, this allows the other members to schedule their work around you and it also ensures that 2 people are not doing the same thing. Communication is key and the more you understand the value for it and the more the team is organised as early as possibly in the team’s assignment stage. As mentioned above leaving your project to the last minute will bring many disadvantages with it including increased stress and workload.</p>

              <p>Trust is also crucial to a high performing team, team members must be comfortable in confiding in each other about any project related issues. As well as this, if trust is present between team members, they can be certain that others will behave as expected in performing their tasks.</p>
