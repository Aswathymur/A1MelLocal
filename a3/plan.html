            <h2>Justification: Luke Vo (Tran Cong Nguyen Vo)</h2>
            <p>I've started developing basic skill for the project since week 2 and I plan to spend around 3 hours a day for six days every week to work on the project. 
                A lot of new knowledge on programming skills is required to develop the final outcome and I'm very experienced with designing. Therefore, I use most of 
                my time on learning and researching examples on Python, Python Flask, more advanced Javascript, Web Programming skills and implement them in developing 
                our application. For MVF, I'm responsible for designing the prototype interfaces of Displaying Cost Information and I want to contribute my designing 
                with Business Advertisement and Experience Review as I like designing user interface. Iâ€™m very interested in learning and research on Image Recognition 
                as it is a brand new area for me and I want to broaden my knowledge in the IT world.  </p>

            <p>The Search filtering takes the least amount of time as retrieving data from the database with a match to the user query 
                s comparatively easier that the other tasks. I have experience in the same. Mobile App development as an EVF takes the most amount of time. 
                This is because the feature is very new, and I have never worked with this before. Other tasks such as User registration is also a familiar code 
                which I have used before.  Display Cost Information and Business Advertisement in the MVF is not too easy but is also not the hardest task. 
                These two features do need a fair amount of dedication and work. Experience Review is another hard task that requires a lot of effort to learn.  </p>

            <p>The time taken to learn and implement each of the new tasks take an average of at least 23 hours each. The time taken is so elaborated as these are new tasks that 
                I have not encountered so far. I do have the highest time total compared to other team members this is because I like to plan an hour extra than What I
                would usually take for better time management. The shortest time taken is for business advertisement. I have spent a bit of time with this aspect of code. 
                This reduced time due to that, whereas using location of the user to find the weather and display is quite new to me and hence, the extra hours in that. 
                Displaying Cost information also takes a long time to learn as it needs to take data from the business users input which is later updated into the user database. 
                This has to also work along with the search filter function. 
                These hours are just an estimate from the wide research, plus or minus 3 hours is a possible fluctuation. </p>

                All the MVF features have a very low number compared to the EVF features, this is because the EVF features are more advanced and require a 
                lot of time and effort to learn and build. Web App is the highest time taking feature, with 30 hrs. Image recognition takes 25hrs. These 2 
                features are the most challenging features. All the MVF features have a lower time due to their lower difficulty. User registration takes the 
                highest time out of all the MVF features, as this involves storing valuable information to the database.</p>

            <h2>Justification: Eliza Gilbert</h2>
            <p>I have allocated less time to the user and business registraiton portions of the projects, because these are standard features that should be easier to implement as there are a multitude of resources that relate to forms for the technologies that we plan to utilise (Flask/MongoDB).</p>

            <p>Similarly I have allocated around about the same amount of time for the map search feature as from my initial research most of the UI features of the map (zoom in/zoom out) will be built in with javascript with whichever library we use. This means that we will only need to implement the search feature mostly on the backend using MongoDB queries.</p>

            <p>I have allocated the most amount of time to the Image Recognition features, as I do not have any experience with  this type of development nor do I beieve my group has. This may mean that the research for these features and implementation may take longer. I also added extra hours to the 'web app' extendable viable feature because if the initial frontend of the website is not mobile responsive, it may need to be wholly restructured. As well as this performance issues with flask and running such an in intensive application that uses maps would likely mean changes to the backend as well in order to make MelLocal mobile compatible. The database however would be suitable for reuse for a mobile platform. </p>

            <h2><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Python Flask v1.1.2</a></h2>
            <p>Flask is a lightweight microframework that makes the development of a model/view/controller application easier. 
            It allows the developer to specify models that incoming data must adhere to. It also has the ability to render templates using the built-in Jinja templating engine.</p>

            <p>We have chosen Python Flask as it has less of a learning curve than other frameworks such as Django and this will aid the speed of our development.</p>

            <!-- MongoDB -->
            <h2><a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/">MongoDB Community Server Edition v4.4.1(current)</a></h2>

            <p>MongoDB is a noSQL database system that can return JSON and doesn't require a strict definition of its tables (referred to as collections). MongoDB does not have relationships in the same way as a RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) instead it uses references (embedded) to other collections within the collection itself.</p>

            <!-- Pymongo -->
            <h2><a href="https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pymongo v3.11.0</a></h2>

            <p>Pymongo is a python package that assist the Python programming language in interacting with MongoDB. It includes many tools and shortcut functions and includes a native python driver for Python/MongoDB.</p>

            <!-- Mongoengine -->
            <h2><a href="http://mongoengine.org/">Mongoengine</a></h2>

            <p>Mongoengine is a ODM (Object-Document Mapper) that serves as an abstraction layer over the Mongo database and pymongo driver. It simplifies the code you need to write for defining classes, inserting collections and performing database operations.

            <!-- Pip -->
            <h2><a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">Pip v20.2.2</a></h2>

            <p>In order to install the Python packages that we require (Flask, pymongo) we may need to use Pip, which stands for Pip Installs Packages. Pip was developed by the MIT and allows the seamless addition of many python modules to a local system using the terminal/command prompt.</p>

            <!-- Amazon EC2 -->
            <h2><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Web Services: EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)</a></h2>

            <p>AWS allows you to rent virtual computers in order to host your application. Using a free tier instance we plan on deploying the backend (Flask) part of our application using Amazon's EC2. Using an Amazon Machine Image (Ubuntu Server) we will be able to run Flask and Amazon will scale up instances of the application as required.</p>

            <!-- Amazon S3 -->
            <h2><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Web Services: S3 (Simple Storage Service)</a></h2>

            <p>For our front end assets (.png, .jpg) we plan on using Amazon's S3 service to store these objects that will be acessable via a web interface. This will provide fast delivery of our static assets that will be served by the Flask application.</p>

            <!-- Github -->
            <h2><a href="https://github.com/Aswathymur/A1MelLocal">Github</a></h2>

            <p>Github is website that provides a graphical user interface for the commands line tool Git. Git will allow us to control our development workflow, and create different branches for development. It also allows for easier collaboration, and the ability to revert our codebase. Once we have a working codebase we can merge our changes into once source.</p>

            <p>Some initial research has been performed for the backend portion of our application using technologies we wish to implement.</p>

            <p>Flask connected to SQLite <a href="https://github.com/Aswathymur/A1MelLocal/tree/master/flask-template" target="_blank">Git Commit</a></p>

            <p>Similarly our team member Harry created some classes using MongoDB and NodeJS, see this <a href="https://rmiteduau.sharepoint.com/:v:/s/BuildingITSystemsSemester22020-AR-FR-330-Legs/EZTMpER6QaZEumBvgxyet2cB1ZpFl4b5ejrzKnk7b-LSHA?e=kEFCbz" target="_blank">video</a></p>

            <p>These MongoDB classes were later converted to Python, see <i>this</i> <a href="https://github.com/Aswathymur/A1MelLocal/blob/master/flask-mongodb/mongo_connect.py" target="_blank">Git Commit</a> </p>
