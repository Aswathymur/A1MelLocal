              <h2>Skills and Jobs</h2>
              <p>The biggest reasons for delays in our development was, as mentioned previously, the setup of the development environment. Since in a real world IT team, developer operations aka DevOps are usually the ones to assist developers in this regard, we feel as though this role was missing from MelLocal. Team members were spending a lot of time communicating the correct versions and running environments for their platforms/database. Usually the productivity would be sped up by a lot of these problems being solved by someone specialised in setting up these systems, for example by using Docker containers to virtualize and bundle the required software in a package. This greatly reduces the need to compile dependency lists and source those required dependencies.</p>

              <p>A developer operations specialist would also be able to assist in the hosting of the application at the time when it is due to go live. The setup of SSL on the server was not achieved on AWS, however since this requirement was not within scope it was not pursued further. However since this would contribute greatly to the overall security of the website, someone who has knowledge of these security concepts would be a great asset to the team. A security consultant could also help us to perform a penetration test on our website to expose any vulnerable endpoints in our application.</p>

              <p>Apart from our logo, the resulting look of our website was a lot different to what was initially conceived. The role of a Brand Manager, or an individual who would maintain the consistency and representation of the MelLocal brand across all platforms (web, social media etc.) would be of great benefit to MelLocal. This would ensure our business integrity and guarantee that customers know exactly who we are. Once the initial customer base has been established, a business relation manager could perform outreach to businesses in Melbourne to try to expand the range of offerings available to MelLocal users. Someone with good business acumen and a strong sales record would be suitable for this role.</p>
