              <h4>Marketing Pitch</h4>

              <p>New to Melbourne? But Google Maps only shows you the boring popular museums and shopping malls that everyone knows about. You want something new, something unique and interesting, places that make you feel more Melbourne? MelLocal is the perfect app that you need, where you can find all the hidden gems and do all the fun "local things" in this city of joy. You will have all the handy information that you need like Average Cost or Weather Forecast of the place to get you fully ready before getting there. The app provides interesting and useful categories for the users to find places of what they actually want, and need, such as Group Activities, Local Things, ATM, Toilets, Public Transport. MelLocal distinguishes itself from other ordinary Map Applications by realistically fulfilling the user needs of “discovering and experiencing Melbourne”, rather than just visiting popular tourist attractions.</p>

              <p>One of the highlighted features of the app is Image Recognition. Tourists can simply capture an image of a location to retrieve its information on prices, reviews and ratings from previous visitors. They can also capture an image of a monument or historical building to gather information on its history. Thus, delivering an insightful and fun experience when using the app. As a small team of students with knowledge in designing and application development, understanding our target users and their needs, we have created a functional beta version of the application with the short time we had, this demo represents the foundation of the final product and the vision of changing the way our users travel and explore Melbourne.</p>
