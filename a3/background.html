                    <h2>Project Background</h2>
                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                    <p>The tourism industry is very valuable to the state of Victoria, prior to the pandemic forecasts redirected that the tourism industry would contribute to 56% of the economic growth for the next decade in visitor expenditure ("Value of Victoria's tourism industry", 2020). </p>

                    <p>Our goal was to help remedy this economic downturn with a web platform that would connect tourists with local Melbourne businesses. Since technology is serving to keep us functional during times of quarantine, it can also help to connect us post-pandemic. We envision MelLocal as an application that can help to kickstart the visitor economy during this downturn. </p>

                    <p>Not only that, the main reason for us to take over this assignment is to target international students  and help them out  in a most efficient way. According to a survey, over 200,000 students from 170 countries choose Melbourne for education purposes  annually. The majority of them come to Melbourne with high expectations, wishing to experience the best of Melbourne. Due to the high costs of existing tourist websites, who often promote middle men, most of the students are limited by cost in experiencing what Melbourne has to offer. Combined with a high study load, international students would like an efficient and straight to the point way of finding Melbourne experiences within their price range. </p>

                    <p>By building MelLocal, we aim to provide the best solutions to Melbourne visitors with proper guidance and a reasonable cost. We believe that most of the students/tourists as well as Melbourne businesses can benefit from a win/win in terms of connecting to each other and creating value via our platform. </p>

                    <h3>People</h3>

                    <h4>Aswathy (Ash) Murali Ottur</h4>
                    <h5>Interest in Topic/Skills</h5>
                    <p>With no prior knowledge in Github, I’m looking forward to learning more about it. I have worked a lot with designing and website layouts. I am looking forward to learning more about Python Flask and its functions. I am also very excited about converting the website to an app as an Extended Viable Feature. There are also a lot of new concepts and skills that can be learnt from the team, as they all have their strengths in different areas.</p>

                    <h5>Acquired Skills</h5>
                    <p>Data is my strong side and I am hoping to develop more skills in this field to make this my career. Other skills that I developed over the years are HTML, CSS and Java, and improving my skill sets on these are still an ongoing process.</p>

                    <h5>Roles</h5>
                    <p>I was responsible for the development of the search function and contribute to the initial design of its layout. I was also assigned with lots of writing in our reports throughout the project.</p>

                    <h4>Eliza Gilbert</h4>
                    <h5>Interest in Topic/Skills</h5>
                    <p>I am interested in creating meaningful and useful user experiences for our target audience, businesses and users within the state of Victoria. I have some experience with Python MVC (Model/View/Controller) frameworks and building web applications and database design using MySQL. </p>

                    <h5>Acquired Skills</h5>
                    <p>Node/React development, git repository management, managing scope creep. During this project I got to familiarise myself with the same MVC patterns found in Python using Node. I also got to gain knowledge of the workings of Windows Subsystem for Linux, as this was a bridge for us since we had members working on both windows and mac systems. During deployment I gained knowledge of AWS server setup and hosting a node app using the node package pm2. </p>

                    <h5>Roles</h5>

                    <p>As project manager I made sure that we worked together to reach our goal of collaboratively completing the MVF functionality within the time frame. This role also overlapped with a developer operations role, that involved managing the git repository and codebase versions and hosting the final application on AWS. During the initial stages of the project, I was involved with the design of the user signup. </p>

                    <h4>Thuan Le (Harry)</h4>
                    <h5>Interest in Topic/Skills</h5>
                    <p> I always want to create a practical product in my daily life. It motivated me to learn new things and develop it in the best possible way. I am a person who loves to travel and that is the reason why I chose this topic.</p>

                    <h5>Acquired Skills</h5>
                    <p>Working with a team gives me a lot of new knowledge, from dividing work for each member to using software to support teamwork such as Trello, Github, Figma and more. All of these tools I have not experienced before and the team members have taught me a lot on how to use them. More than that, I also find my React / Node programming skills a lot better than I used to be, the things that I'm missing are filled with team members. Everyone has their strength and teamwork helps us exploit it.</p>


                    <h5>Roles</h5>
                    <p> I worked with the database array using Mongodb, then I developed CRUD for the project MVFs using Node and React and finally incorporated the frontend of the other members into my backend. Together with the project manager, we improve the errors in the project to deliver the final product.</p>

                    <h4>Shanogeeth Shanmuganathan</h4>
                    <h5>Interest in Topic/Skills</h5>
                    <p>My interests in the Information technology field are the upcoming technologies, web development, designing,security and common programming skills. My skills are basic but i have some experience in Java, Web development and in Designing. By this assignment, I was able to improve my skills by sharing the knowledge with my fellow team members.</p>

                    <h5>Acquired Skills</h5>
                    <p>By learning this course I was able to learn a new set of skills which improved my knowledge on the IT field. I got to gain knowledge on Node/React , Trello , AWS by the time working on each segment of the assignment. Working in different types of projects , I was able to improve on my strong side of my skills which are Web developing skills and security by the involvement I had in this time period. I am looking forward to improving my other skills in my ongoing process.</p>

                    <h5>Roles</h5>
                    <p>I was assigned to implement  the Experience Review System for this project. I was able to come up with an initial implementation for the Review system at first.  Then with the help of team members, I  made few changes to make it fully functional on Node/React. After successful implementation,we merged the function to the main platform. Apart from coding I was assigned to do lots of writing on the reports we made for this project.</p>

                    <h4>Tran Cong Nguyen Vo (Luke)</h4>
                    <h5>Interest in Topic/Skills</h5>
                    <p>As an international student myself I can directly see the benefits of MelLocal in terms of practicality and the problem the application is solving is one of the problems I faced living in Australia. I've experienced lots of graphics design on website/app interface and visual assets for the past few years and working with clients, but I have never actually done anything with back-end development like working with Javascript or Python. I'm looking forward to collaborate and join small parts in the feature developing process with team members who are experienced in this field and focus on learning and research more on coding knowledge, especially Javascript and Python, during the project and their applications.</p>

                    
                    <h5>Acquired Skills</h5>
                    <p>I’m more on the visual front-end side and I’ve strong experiences with graphic designing softwares, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, Figma and web development HTML, CSS, Jquery, PHP.  Working with a broad variety of industries including dental clinics, marketing solutions, engineering, electronic stores, camera brand, streetwear brand,... allows me to have solid understanding in the business field, which would be beneficial when it comes to the practical side of a project.</p>

                    <h5>Roles</h5>
                    <p>I’m contributing to the front-end, the look of the application from the process of designing the prototype to finalising the end product. I designed the left bar menu, the logo, the location widget and created a foundation of how the application will look. I enhanced the visual representation of the functional application that has been developed by others.</p>

                <article class="section grey" id="scope">
                    <h3>Scope</h3>

                    <p>The scope of the project is to build a MVC (model/view/controller) application with objects to represent:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Users</li>
                        <li>Business Users</li>
                        <li>Business in Melbourne</li>
                        <li>Reviews</li>
                        <li>Categories</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>MelLocal’s goal is to allow users to search those businesses by category and view their cost information (average spend by customers as provided by businesses). Customers should also be able to perform a filtered search and leave reviews for businesses based in Melbourne, a review is an object that references both a user (who left the review) and a business (that they are leaving the review for). Users associated with a business should be able to see their business’ reviews, similarly regular users should be able to view past reviews that they have left for businesses they have visited. The purpose of a User account on MelLocal is for saving places (referred to as favourites) in the application.</p>
