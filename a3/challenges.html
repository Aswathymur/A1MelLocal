                  <h2>Challenges and Learning</h2>

                  <h4>What We Found Easy</h4>

                  <p>At the beginning of this project, we knew the functionality our website needed. So when the whole group discussed how each function worked, everyone’s ideas were quite similar. We started to design the context diagram for each function after we agreed on the database that our website needed. The process to design a diagram was also not too difficult because we could easily imagine the data flow in each function.</p>

                  <p>The front-end as well as back-end design was not that challenging as well as we could easily find on the open sources. Each function was divided into each member and we overcame it relatively easy.</p>

                  <h4>What We Found Difficult</h4>
                  <p>Using different coding languages between other members was also a challenge because we must find the way to connect them together. Appearing a lot of errors or bugs is inevitable. We also spend more time learning a new coding language on this project. Applying many kinds of software like Google Map API to create map interface, Cloudinary to save images and Online MongoDB to save data, sometimes create many conflicts on the database.</p>

                  <p>Trying to stick to the original plan was extremely difficult. What we imagine and practice is very different. From using the design on Figma as well as the coding language that we will use to write the website were also changed to suit with the current situation.</p>

                  <h4>What We Expected</h4>
                  <p>We expected our website to work normally without any errors in processing. We could implement all the MVFs and let it work smoothly with the database from MongoDB. More than that, we hope we can combine all the parts of every member together.</p>

                  <h4>What We Did Not Expect</h4>

                  <p>The major turn in our assignment came when we had two 2 different developments happening simultaneously which led to the switch in the language we started our assignment in. This was not particularly hard if given time, but with the lack of time and the adding work load from other subjects, it slowed down the development stage. The switch in languages from python flask to node.js happened due to the lack of communication the members had.</p>

                  <p>A group member also unexpectedly left our group right before assignment 2 was due. The extra part of the assignment had to be taken up by one of our team members. This led to extra work for team members and with less distribution of workload.</p>

                  <h4>New Skills and experience that we have learned</h4>
                  <p>As a team we have learned a lot throughout this semester. With our assignment starting off from a very basic tourist idea, to creating a logo and making it work, we have improved as a team and have added on a lot of new things to our skill sets. Though the quick switch of language did not give a wide insight, it still gave all of us an experience of at least writing a few lines of it. We also had a good insight into python flask. With 2 languages on board, we managed to grasp the basics of it. We also learnt on how to get the database set up and also increased our skill sets around git.</p>

                  <h4>Things that have not worked out for us</h4>
                  <p>With aspects that did not work for us, the main thing will be everyone being involved in the development process. We were all planning on doing all our individual sections but also to ensure that we had a role in combining all them together. What happened towards the end was that, most of us could not contribute to the final combining of the whole work, due to the lack of knowledge in the language. We could not finish our task as quickly as possible. We were planning on finishing off our MVF and then trying to implement a few of our EVF but the issues we faced throughout the productions face, slowed our progress.</p>

                  <h4>Plan Changes/ What We Have Changed to the Plan</h4>
                  <p>We initially started off by using python flask as our main development language, but due to change of plans and the advantages that node.js offers by our lead developer, we switched to node.js. If we had planned properly earlier on in the development face we could have avoided this last minute shift in progress and confusion. This could have also allowed us to make more progress with full involvement from all team members. Not missing any meeting is the second most important thing we could have worked on. All the issues we faced were due to the 2 week gap we had right after the submission of Assignment 2. We could have had a better communication base outside of Microsoft teams. Microsoft teams is a solid one stop communication for all of us, but maybe having another communication base such as messenger of whatsapp would have kept most members active.</p>

                  <h4>Was our Timetable Realistic?</h4>
                  <p>The timetable we had was close to realistic. The reason it is not 100% is because the time table was set to “meetings every Thursday at 5”. This was beneficial in most of the ways. We had a set time to meet and discuss all the issues we faced throughout the week with our assigned tasks and to set new agenda and goals for the upcoming week. This worked perfectly till our Second assignment. But when we entered the development face, meeting once a week was not enough, and missed meetings by the lead developers lead to slow progress.</p>

                  <p>The timetable could have been improved, taking into account the issues we have faced throughout. The time table could have been more flexible than just a fixed time.</p>

                  <h4>Have the tools and technologies worked out as expected?</h4>
                  <p>Generally the tools and technologies we used, from user interface design with Figma to CRUD development and website interface with Nodejs and Reactjs, database with Online MongoDB, Cloudinary to stored images, Postman to test CRUD functions,  Google Map API to display map interface, all worked out well as expected to us. It was just some problem in the coding process, that was the database had conflict and made the display data messy. We spent much time fixing code and made it work normally like the current final product. Not only that, some softwares we had installed before did not work until we recognized they were in an older version and we had to update them.</p>
