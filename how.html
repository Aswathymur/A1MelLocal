                <h3>Resources & Tools</h3></br>

                <h5>Outlook</h5>
                <p>Since all of our project members are part of RMIT, we chose to use outlook to simplify email
                    communication, and Outlook is the email provider of choice at RMIT. Email will mostly be used in the
                    case that simple text chat is insufficient.</p>
                </br>
                <h5>Code Editor</h5>
                <p>As well as an up to date version of Github, we will require the use of an appropriate code editor,
                    examples include Sublime Text, Visual Studio Editor, Vim etc. This is a personal preference that
                    depends on how comfortable the user is in using the tool.</p>
                </br>
                <h5>Python Flask</h5>
                <p>A microframework for the Python programming language, Python Flask is a lightweight base that uses
                    the model, view, controller software design pattern. We have chosen this framework as a base because
                    it doesn’t require any special tools or libraries. Third party libraries provide the common
                    functionality, such as datetime, and connecting to a database. Other options for our backend
                    development include PHP, other Python Frameworks such as Django, or a Javascript based framework
                    such as NodeJS or Angular. The advantage of this framework is that it is beginner friendly and is
                    not as strict in terms of directory and code structure.</p>
                </br>
                <h5>MySQL</h5>
                <p>MySQL is an extremely popular relational database management system. We will be utilising this
                    database system to store data that will not be retrieved by the APIs. </p></br>

                <h3>Collaborative Workspaces</h3></br>

                <h5>Microsoft Teams</h5></br>
                <p>Microsoft Teams is an application that allows online video and text chat, file storage and
                    application
                    integration. This will be our main communication channel for anything related to the project. Our
                    channel name is AR-FR-330-Legs within the Building IT Systems Team. We are using this platform as it
                    is
                    required by this course and it is easily integrated with other RMIT classes that also use Microsoft
                    Teams.</p>
                </br>
                <h5>Github</h5>
                <p>Link: <a href="https://github.com/Aswathymur/A1MelLocal">Github Repository</a></p>

                <p>As an industry standard for version control and deployment, Github is an extremely useful tool that
                    allows us to collaborate on development. Other alternatives include Bitbucket, owned by Atlassian.
                    Both
                    version control tools have the same terminology and capabilities, however Github has greater
                    recognition
                    within the IT industry.</p>
                </br>
                <h5>Trello</h5>
                <p>Link: <a href="https://trello.com/b/giN4S2rE/ar-fr-330-legs-template-copy">Trello Board</a></p>

                <p>Trello is a Kanban-style list making application also owned by Atlassian. The aim of this application
                    is
                    to create a whiteboard like canvas on which the team can attach ‘sticky notes’. These notes can be
                    assigned to team members and have many formats including the use of images and checkbox content.</p>
                </br>
                <h5>Outlook Calendar</h5>
                <p>So that we can schedule meetings and know the availability of each team member we have chosen to use
                    our
                    Outlook Calendar. This will be populated with any personal or study appointments, so that we are
                    aware
                    of each others’ availability and can schedule project related meetings around these.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="howsection">
                <h3>Communication Expectations</h3></br>
                <p>It is expected that each member of the team should respond to queries within the chat within a 24
                    hour
                    timeframe. As well as this members should communicate via video chat at least 2 hours per week. This
                    will allow us to resolve any issues that arise during the progress of the project and keep each
                    other
                    informed of what we are working on.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="howsection">
                <h3>Decision-making Processes</h3></br>
                <p>In order to keep our project on track, we require a method of resolving conflicts and prevent our
                    group
                    members from going off on different tangents. In the case of the project encountering a fork in the
                    road, the main aspect of the scope that we need to preserve will be the time taken to implement the
                    minimum viable features. As we have discussed in our group meetings, the biggest risk to our project
                    will be time, however this is intrinsically linked to the technical abilities of our group. Because
                    of
                    this, the different alternatives and directions the project can go in must be assessed in terms of
                    the
                    quality of tools that we are using. Third party plugins and dependencies that require a lot of
                    technical
                    overhead and lack documentation may greatly slow down our development progress.</p>

                <p>Decisions regarding the fine grain features of the project need to be assessed by the group member
                    who
                    will be responsible for producing the deliverables for the task. This involves self assessment and
                    an
                    estimation of how much effort integrating a particular tool or going in a specific direction will
                    take.
                    These decisions will be discussed with the group so that each member is informed of the outcome.</p>
